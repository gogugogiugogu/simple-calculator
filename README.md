Learned to create a working calculator with the option to break the script on request

Used a little help from ChatGPT, but hey - if it makes it easier to learn and not just copy paste scripts, then all the better for it!

The script was tested, debugged (a lot for a fact) and uploaded finally, it took me more than a day to figure it out because i had barely enough time yesterday.
